= SemanticMenu

A plugin to make large menus easier to write.

Supports arbitrarily deep nesting; parents will be marked as 'active' if any of its children are active.

== Example

<%= semantic_menu do |root|
  root.add "overview", root_path
  root.add "comments", comments_path
end %>

Assuming you are on /comments, the output would be:

<ul class="menu">
  <li>
    <a href="/">overview</a>
  </li>
  <li class="active">
    <a href="/comments">comments</a>
  </li>
</ul>
